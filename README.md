# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project focuses on a comprehensive predictive data analysis of airline passengers' satisfaction. The objective is to explore the key factors influencing customer experiences, such as flight distance, legroom service, gate location, and arrival delays, and predict passenger satisfaction levels using machine learning models.

## Project Overview

The project aims to uncover insights into what affects passenger satisfaction, using rigorous data analysis techniques, including:
- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing and cleaning the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating and visualizing the relationships between various factors and satisfaction levels.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applying machine learning models to predict satisfaction based on multiple factors and identify the key drivers.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, corrects data inconsistencies, and prepares the data for analysis.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Analyzes various factors like flight distance, legroom service, gate location, and delays to understand their impact on satisfaction.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict passenger satisfaction and determine which factors have the most influence.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and EDA.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
